  Challenge #4. Persisting the data
</h1>

In this 4th challenge we are going to persist our data into PostgreSQL.

## Instructions


* Create a new service that will receive the Ad created in challenge1 and will persist it.
* The easiest way for local development is to use a docker image for PostgreSQL.
* Since we already went thorough error handling and testing we can handle all possible scenarios
