  Challenge #5. Go routines
</h1>

In this 5th challenge we are going to use go routines to see if the ad was posted also on other
platforms

## Instructions


* Create a new method that receives the ad, reads the list of sites that should be searched from the database and saves
  in a new table the connections between the ad id and id's of sites that was also posted
* If the time is short you can use an in-memory hardcoded list, the point of the exercise being to play with routines
* The sites table can be filled with how many sites you want (manual or script, however you want).
* You can use random functions to return if an ad was posted to a site or no
* The method should be called async while saving the ad and not interrupt the save flow.
